# Unabridged talk on web publishing

This is the repository for my talk on web publishing options at Harvard, to be delivered in January of 2022 to participants in the "Unabridged" workshop at Harvard University.

## Getting started - for workshop participants

If you've never put something on the web before, you can try it out pretty easily. Go to [atg.fas.harvard.edu/scalar](https://atg.harvard.edu/scalar) to register to use the platform. Once you have your account set up, you can create a new site to try out. You can make whatever you like, but if you need an idea, try asking folks around Harvard about their favorite lunch spots and putting them on the site. It's a great opportunity to try out tags and the map widget!
